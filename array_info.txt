Char size is 1 byte
Int size is 2 bytes
Float size is 4 bytes


A[10]
Size =10 // # elements in the array
A is the name of the array
0 lower bound
9 upper bound
Array starting address is base address also a first element address


6th element address is = base address + 6 *2 (esize)

Int A[23]
Size = 23
Lower bound =0
Upper bound = 22
46 bytes of memory is  needed to store this array (23 * 2 ) int size 2 bytes
Let  base address is 2019.
Size of the each element  2 bytes
Esize= size of the element
Address of A[19] = 2019 + 19 * 2

Formula to find address of an ith element in the array= base address + i * esize
